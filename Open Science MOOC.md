# Rationale

Research is getting a global makeover, in part thanks to the power of the internet and the tools it provides for us, and in part due to a growing call for accountability (e.g., reproducibility and data provenance) in research. Global policies are emerging at different levels that include some aspect of ‘Open Research’, ‘Open Scholarship’, or ‘Open Science’, and inclusive of all research disciplines. But our universities are often letting us down, and they are not teaching us the knowledge, tools and skills we need to do research effectively in the 21st century. 

Open Science is about increased rigour, accountability, reproducibility for research. It is based on the principles of inclusion, fairness, equity, and sharing. Open Science can be viewed as research simply done properly, and it extends across the Life and Physical Sciences, Engineering, and Mathematics, to Social Science and Humanities.

This MOOC is designed to help equip students and researchers with the skills they need to excel in a modern research environment. It brings together the efforts and resources of hundreds of researchers and practitioners who have all dedicated their time and experience to create a community platform to help propel research forward. 

The content of this MOOC is distilled into 10 core modules that comprise some of the most important current topics in Open Science. Each module will comprise a complete range of resources including videos, research articles, dummy datasets and code, as well as ‘homework’ tasks to complete as individuals. The MOOC will be hosted through OpenEdX, an open source provider. We expect that in the future different systems of certification will be developed, including completion badges. We also intend to build a forum for the open discussion of the MOOC and any relevant topics.

**_Disclaimer: _**We, the contributors, are fully aware that there is no magic "one size fits all solution" when it comes to implementing Open Science philosophies and best practices, especially when covering all research disciplines. However, we also believe that we should not limit ourselves from the onset, just because pragmatic solutions may not exist today for certain disciplines. We aim to set a highly inclusive standard, fully accepting the risk that for some disciplines this strategy may not be fully appropriate. Through that failure, we hope that you, the course users, will join us as course contributors and help us co-create bespoke solutions to your discipline based on principles of transparency, provenance, reproducibility and reuse of knowledge.

**_Conceptual model of the Open Science MOOC (_****_to be redrawn to match final 10 chapters_****_)_**

# Proposed Structure

A 10-module course with each one focussing on making each step or aspects of the research lifecycle more transparent and accountable, collaborative and efficient, and reusable and easier to build upon. 

An introduction to open principles as an initial course, with several modules (chapters) to follow with more detailed discussions of different aspects of the open science movement. Each module is a stepping stone to a more transparent and accountable, collaborative and efficient, re-usable and easier research lifecycle.

# Modules

## 1: Open Principles

**_Rationale (_****_3 lines max_****_)_**: 

*To innovate in a field frequently implies moving against prevailing trends and cultural inertia. Open Science is no different. No matter how convinced you are, you will come across resistance from peers and colleagues, and the best defence is strong personal conviction that what you are doing may not be perfect now, but is the right decision in the long run. This module will introduce the guiding principles of the ‘open movement’, the different actors involved, and the impact that they are having.*

**_Learning Objectives (1-3 specific)_**: 

*LO1a: Understand the ethical, **legal**, social, economic, and research impact arguments for and against Open Science (knowledge).*

*LO1b: Set up a personal profile for defining your impact: measure the social and academic attention on the full range of research processes and outputs** (tasks).*

### Key components:

* What is "Open Science", and why should we care. 

* History of Open Science and Open Cultures.

* Differences and commonalities in understanding and interpretation of the term.

* Communities and diversity, inclusivity, fairness, equity, social behaviour, accountability, ethics and responsibility.

* Open Science on a global scale. 

* How Open Science influences your career now and the future of research evaluation.

* Open licensing, copyright, and speaking ‘legalise’.

* The different dimensions of Open Science (e.g., Open Access, Open Data, Open Peer Review).

* What are some of the barriers to Open Science, and why.

* Open science and reproducible research: 2 sides of the same coin?

* Open science in daily work: design your workflow with sharing in mind and invest time early.

### Tasks:

* Get an [ORCID](orcid.org) account, and fill out your profile. This is a unique identifier for you as a researcher.

* Get a [Publons](https://publons.com/home/) account, integrate with your new ORCID, and valorise your reviewer effort!

* Get an [ImpactStory](http://impactstory.org/) account, and integrate with ORCID, showcase your output (not just publications)!

* Write a summary about Open Access efforts either on your research discipline and/or in your country. If you have a website or blog, post it there.

    * Were the data for this easy to acquire? Which sources did you use?

* Look at the status of Open Science in your research group or lab. Make a note of who is doing what. What could be improved?

* Define clearly what Open Science means to you. Have a conversation about it with a colleague. Then, find someone from a different country, and have another conversation about Open Science. 

* Find out the policies are in your department or institute regarding:

    * Career progression and assessment.

    * Publishing and Open Access.

    * Data sharing.

    * Intellectual Property (IP).

* Identify any disciplinary repositories either for research articles or data. 

### Learning outcomes:

1. The researcher will be able to describe the ethical, legal, social, economic, and research impact arguments for and against Open Science.

2. After deciding which platforms/tools/services are most useful for themselves and their community, the researcher will develop a personal profile for showcasing their research profile and outputs.

3. After reflecting on the status of Open Science within their research group or lab, the researcher will devise concrete ways to locally improve open practices. 

4. Using the guidelines published by their research laboratories, departments, or institutes, researchers will identify the policies for career progression and assessment, publishing and open access, data sharing, and intellectual property. 

5. Researchers will collaborate with colleagues and international peers to develop a shared definition of Open Science. 

## 2: Open Collaboration

**_Rationale (_****_3 lines max_****_)_**: 

*Research is becoming an increasingly collaborative process, driven by a combination of technical opportunities and more complex research questions. **Virtual Research Environments (VRE) are the way of the future in collaboration across continents, time zones and disciplines. While the definition of a VRE may be up for grabs, they provide powerful examples of high-performing modern research tools. In this module you will develop an understanding of collaborative platforms that work today, and how they can greatly enhance your research workflows.*

**_Learning Objectives (_****_specific_****_): _**

*LO2a: Learn what major types of collaborative platforms are available and what the use cases for each might be (knowledge).*

*LO2b: Be able to use a variety of collaborative research platforms (tasks).*

### Key components:

* Principles of collaborative research.

* Documentation as conversation and collaboration.

* Version control, organising repositories, and project management ([GitHub](http://github.com/), [Git](https://git-scm.com/), [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/)).

* Virtual Research Environments (VRE) on the horizon (e.g., EU projects on VREs).

* Website and content management.

* Collaborative writing platforms.

* Collective annotation services.

* Community spaces and communication tools.

2. After deciding what works optimally for their workflow, the researcher will be able to use collaborative tools such as GitHub and the Open Science Framework for increased collaboration for the research process, writing/authoring, and sharing your research outputs.

3. The researcher will be able to collaborate with colleagues to annotate preprints or other published articles, and share this discussion with the original authors and wider research community.

## 3: Reproducible Research and Data Analysis

**_Rationale (_****_3 lines max_****_)_**: 

*Reproducible research is at the heart of science.** There has been an increased need and willingness to open and share research from the data **collection **right through to the interpretations of results. This has come with its own set of challenges, which include designing workflows that can be adopted by collaborators in a way that does not compromise the integrity of their contribution. This module will introduce the necessary tools required for transparent reporting which is reproducible and readable.* 

**_Learning Objectives (_****_specific_****_)_**: 

*LO3a: Learn about the nature of reproducible research, workflow design, data management and manipulation, dynamic reporting, what the key requirements are, and which resources are available to support these (knowledge)**.*

*LO3b: Be able to use available resources to create a workflow for reproducible research (task).*

### Key components:

* Factors that affect reproducibility of research.

* Principles of reproducibility, and integrity and ethics in research.

* What is the ‘reproducibility crisis’, and meta-analyses of reproducibility.

* Open materials, reagents and hardware, including resources, repositories and standards.

* Electronic lab notebooks.

* Data analysis documentation and open research workflows.

* Living figures, turning scripts into reproducible documents, and Markdown.

* Pre-registration and prevention of p-hacking/HARK-ing (Hypothesising After Results are Known).

* Reproducible analysis environments (virtualization).

* What are the computing options and environments that allow collaborative and reproducible set up.

### Tasks:

* Find a core data set that is used throughout the examples.

    * If possible, the dataset should have a diverse set of formats and styles for different types of analysis.

* Designing a reproducible research workflow.

    * Create a flowchart of options to help get you started Check if your collaborators, colleagues or supervisors are using the same tools.

    * This can be created as a Google doc and shared for collaboration.

    * Use validated, standardized reagents where possible.

    * Use an electronic lab notebook and best practices for recording protocols and actual steps, reagents used.

* How well annotated are your code scripts? As a general rule of thumb, try and include one comment for every three lines of code. Bear in mind, the primary audience is future you and other people less familiar with your code.

* Posting raw and cleaned data files.

    * Post your data (raw and/or treated) online in a non-proprietary format.

    * Make sure it is in a place where you can get a unique identifier for it.

* Write a study plan or protocol.

    * Preregister your study design using [AsPredicted](https://aspredicted.org/), [OSF](https://osf.io/), or [Registered Reports](https://cos.io/rr/).

    * For clinical trials use [Clinicaltrials.gov](https://clinicaltrials.gov/).

* Set up a reproducible project using an electronic lab notebook to help organise and track your research. 

    * Track changes as your research develops using a version control system such as GitHub.

    * Document everything done by creating a README file.

    * Make sure to select an appropriate license for your repo.

    * Convert the notebook into a standard research manuscript.

    * In this manuscript, include all necessary code to reproduce any figures and tables in their respective captions.

### Learning outcomes:

1. Researchers will be able to describe the key factors that affect the reproducibility of research, including workflow design, data management, and reporting.

2. The researcher will be able to use a range of resources to create and implement a workflow for reproducible research, including using lab notebooks and tools for sharing code and data. 

## 4: Open Research Data 

**_Rationale (_****_3 lines max_****_)_**: 

*Open research data refers to the publishing the data underpinning scientific research results so that they have no restrictions on their access. Openly sharing data opens it up to inspection and re-use, forms the basis for research verification and reproducibility, and opens up a path to broader collaboration. In this module, you will gain insight into the importance of data sharing for reproducible research and how to curate and share your own research data.*

**_Learning Objectives (_****_specific_****_)_**:

*LO4a: Learn the characteristics of open data, understand the advantages and disadvantages (alternatively, arguments for and against) open data (knowledge).*

*LO4b: Be able to turn a closed data set made for personal use into an open data set made for maximised accessibility, transparency, and re-use (task). *

2. Researchers will be able to share their research data openly to a relevant public repository in a way that conforms to the FAIR principles.

3. The researcher will be able to locate and re-use datasets for their research from relevant disciplinary repositories.

## 5: Open Research Software and Open Source

**_Rationale (_****_3 lines max_****_)_**: 

*Software and technology underpin modern** science.** There is an increasing demand for more sophisticated open source software, matched by an increasing willingness for researchers to openly collaborate on new tools. These developments come with a specific ethical, legal and economic challenges that impact upon research workflows. This module will introduce the necessary tools required for transforming software into something that can be openly accessed and re-used by others.*

### Tasks:

* Get an overview of the relevant journals and publishing outlets in your research discipline.

    * Which ones have Open Access options.

    * How much do they each charge for Open Access.

    * What funds are available to you to cover these (where relevant).

* Preferably, find out which diamond/platinum OA journals (i.e., those which do not charge APCs) with high-quality editorial policies exist in your field.

    * Check the description of the peer review process.

    * Check which other additional services are offered by the journal (e.g., XML conversion, publication of updated versions, text and data mining allowances).

    * Check journal ‘whitelists’ (e.g., [The Norwegian Register for Scientific Journals, Series and Publishers](https://dbh.nsd.uib.no/publiseringskanaler/Forside.action?request_locale=en)).

* Draft a summary statement/report outlining the pros and cons of these outlets (e.g., editorial quality, OA policies).

    * What do your colleagues think about the credibility, advantages, and disadvantages of these outlets?

    * How does this compare to your views?

* Simple exercises on average "cost of a paper"; for example the average institute budget/publication output, or your last research grant/papers out compared to the average ‘gold Open Access’ cost in that discipline.

* Find out if you are eligible for funds to pay for article-processing charges APCs.

    * Is the policy from your funder or institute?

    * What are the conditions?

* Find a way to make all of your research papers legally freely available.

    * Use SHERPA/RoMEO to detangle the legalese in publishing contracts.

    * Check with [Dissem.in](https://dissem.in/) which of your papers can be made Open Access via self-archiving.

    * Self-archive one paper (can be previously published) or share a pre-print to an archive. 

    * Make sure to identify and include all relevant metadata (e.g. publisher requires citation with a URL to the final published version).

* Check ImpactStory to see the impact of your research outputs.

    * What can be improved? 

    * What happens to your Open Access score when you self-archive your papers?

* Request an article using the OA Button.

    * Perhaps consider a Green OA advocacy volunteer effort for your discipline or a favorite journal in the spirit of the [Library Pipeline Green OA Working Group](https://www.librarypipeline.org/lis-publications/green-open-access/ ).

* Look for a local OA journal at your university or in your region.

    * Is there a preprint server for your research discipline?

### Learning outcomes:

1. The researcher will become familiar with the history of scholarly publishing, and development of the present Open Access landscape. 

2. The researcher will gain a multi-stakeholder insight into Open Access, and be able to convey a balanced overview of the perceived advantages and disadvantages associated with Open Access publishing.

3. The researcher will be able to describe some of the complexities of the current the Open Access landscape, including allowances for self-archiving and embargoes, copyright transfer, and publishing contracts.

4. Based on community-specific practices, the researcher will be able to use the different types of outlets (repositories) available for self-archiving, as well as the range of Open Access journal types available to them.

5. Each researcher will able to make all of their own research papers Open Access through a combination of journals and development of a personal self-archiving protocol.

6. Researchers will be able to describe the current ebb and flow in the debates around preprints, and be able to locate and use relevant disciplinary preprint platforms.

7. Researchers will be able to use services like ImpactStory to track the proportion of their research that is Open Access.

    * Find out who wrote them, and ask them what evidence they used to support the criteria.

### Learning outcomes:

1. The researcher will be able to describe the history of peer review in the context of scholarly publishing, the criticisms levied against ‘traditional’ peer review, and the ongoing developments with Open Peer Review.

2. The researcher will be able to use a range of post-publication review, commenting, and annotation services. 

3. The researcher will be able to describe the issues associated with the use of ‘traditional’ metrics in research evaluation, and the role that peer evaluation and ‘next-generation’ metrics (or ‘altmetrics’) play in this.

4. The researcher will be able to use a range of services to build and demonstrate their personal research impact profile, both quantitatively and qualitatively.

5. The researcher will become familiar with the relevant criteria for research evaluation to them, and be able to have a critical discussion about them with their colleagues and those who drafted them.

## 8: Public Engagement with Science

**_Rationale (_****_3 lines max_****_)_**: 

*Citizen science describes the method of engaging people outside of academia within the research process itself. **Science communication is often seen as a unidirectional process from scientist to non-scientists, but with careful and strategic engagement they can both be so much more. For this, a deeper understanding of the basics of communication and engagement and existing structures are needed, as well as the capabilities of newer channels like social media. This module will teach effective techniques for communicating your research with a wider non-academic audience, as well as engaging them with the process itself.*

**_Learning Objectives (_****_specific_****_)_**: 

*LO8a: Understand the basic concepts and the viewpoints of different stakeholders in science communication (knowledge).*

*LO8b: Understand the different target groups/audiences and communication channels, who to involve in what kind of communication, and how to do it strategically and with which tools (knowledge).*

*LO8c: Develop either a citizen science program to empower non-academics interested in your research field, or a personal communication strategy to bring your research to a wider audience (tasks).  *

### Key components:

* Basics and principles of science communication, public outreach and engagement, and their relationship to Open Science.

* Different stakeholders and audiences in public engagement and science communication, and how to shape messages for each of them.

* Press releases and interacting with the media.

* Different forms of social media:

    * How and why to blog about your research.

    * Using Twitter for outreach, conferences and networking.

    * How to use video and audio for outreach.

* How to connect with citizen science initiatives, public advocacy groups, and  patient organizations in your research area.

* How to take your research to the stage (e.g., FameLab, Science Slam, Cosy Science).

* When sh*t hits the fan - basics in crisis communication.

### Who to involve:

* Individuals: Dawn Bazely, Melanie Smallman, Lou Woodley, Caren Cooper, Shannon Dosemagen, Muki Hakley, Karen James, Elodie Chabrol, Andre Lampe.

* Organisations: [Public Labs](http://publiclabs.org), [European Citizen Science Association](https://ecsa.citizen-science.net/),

### Tasks:

* Write a letter to your local political representative about why you think research is important.

    * What do politicians care about? Use this context to empathise with them and deliver your message effectively.

* Send an email to an editor (or editorial board) of a ‘closed access’ journal in your field to start the OA conversation.

    * Is the journal OA already (or ‘hybrid’)? How much are APCs for it? Are there any cheaper alternatives they might not be aware of?

* Does your research institute have a magazine, forum, or newsletter? Write a letter/post for it in support of Open Science.

* Draft your own email template reply for requests to peer review about how you only review for OA journals.

    * Re-use/base it on ones out there already. What has worked or not worked so well in the past?

* Outline opportunity costs for your university administrators on role of Open Science in hiring, tenure and promotion guidelines.

    * Outline concrete solutions and benefits Open Science can deliver for current headaches university administrators may struggle with.

* Find your local Open Science advocacy group and volunteer for them!

    * Does one not exist yet? Why not start one! Local groups are a great way to meet like-minded individuals and work together.

    * Having a webpage like Meetup can help keep people engaged and aware of meetings.

### Learning outcomes:

1. The researcher will gain an appreciation of, and be able to identify, the diversity of different communities and stakeholders in scholarly communication, and the potential impact that Open Science can have on them.

2. The researcher will become an effective leader in Open Science, and use their skills and knowledge to empower others.

3. By working either alone or with like-minded colleagues, the researcher will either join or establish a local open science advocacy group or meetup, and identify concrete action steps that they can take together.

4. The research will prepare an open science statement to distribute to administrative staff at their research institute, as well as any other relevant local stakeholders.

5. Together with like-minded colleagues, the researcher will start the ‘open access conversation’ with the editorial board of a relevant journal in their field.
