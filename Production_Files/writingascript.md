Writing a script (audio or video)
=================================

The purpose of creating a script is to create a narrative or storyline
for your media. It should have a clear flow, with a distinct beginning,
middle, and ending for viewers. A strong main question or theme helps to
provide focus and engage viewers.

A standard script should have three parts:

1.  A beginning or introduction

    a.  What is the purpose of this video, and why is it relevant

    b.  Can start with a misconception or key question

    c.  Can even start with an answer to highlight what the video is for

2.  A middle, the main part

    d.  What are the key points and concepts

    e.  Make sure each part is interconnected

    f.  Link each part to the purpose of the video

3.  An end, the conclusion

    g.  Summarise the key points made

    h.  Relate the conclusion to the initial question, the purpose of
        the video, and the wider context of the module

Tips for script writing
-----------------------

-   Keep it simple

    -   No jargon

    -   Concentrate on simpler concepts that are easier to grasp

    -   If it needs to be complicated, be careful with language

    -   Make sure words are easy to pronounce

    -   Remember things sound differently in writing than orally

-   Use active language

    -   In the present tense and familiar terminologies (where possible)

    -   Keep sentences short to help flow

-   Address the audience

    -   Use terms like 'we' or 'us' or 'together'

    -   Ask questions directly to the audience

-   Length

    -   Shorter videos are more engaging

    -   Keep it short -- 5/6 minutes is a good target
